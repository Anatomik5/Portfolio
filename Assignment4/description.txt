1) i plot Mean Traces to Analyze it
2) According to the graph I, defined the rounds
S-Box, was defined because of 16 repeated down peaks as First all 16 Sboxes are computed
After S-box we have ShiftRows
Tham we have 4 Mix Columns, we can see from graph 3 dividers, I matched it with arrows
with it this round divided by 4 
3) 1st step of SPA was made, I detected the rounds 
4) From varience we can see that dispersion before 52k is less. Also mult_By_2 is different, now I should look closer at this way
5) Mixcolumns 
2 3 1 1  
1 2 3 1
1 1 2 3
3 1 1 2
6) I should recover the first key byte using SPA.
Step 1) x= p1 XOR c1
Step 2) x= S-Box(x)
Step 3) x= ShiftRow(x) -> because it is 1st byte it stays the same
Step 4) x= MixColumn(x)

We get  MixColumn(S-Box(p1 XOR c1))

According to Mixcolumn our 1st byte will be multiplied by 2
MixColumn is started in 50k and ended in 110k

From the visual inspection my first Mixcolumn is between 50k to 65k
What decreases the field of traces for my SPA 

SPA.m is for Analyze
SPA_1 Attack on 50k to 65k Mixcolumn with mult_By_2, with which I can define the difference
