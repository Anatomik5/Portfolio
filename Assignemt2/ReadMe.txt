1) I used Matlab for Assignment2
2) To plot plot_nrtraces_t_XX, I used first time 300 000 samples, but that was not enough for first byte, that is why i checked this byte with 500 000 samples. I did not used 1 000 000 samples, because my code will demand too much time to compile.
3)Sbox.csv is my Sbox Data in Decimal that I used for Sbox function in Matlab Code
Source Codes:
4) Attack Matlab file is for plot_k_t_XX.png
5) Attack_step Matlab file is for plot_nrtraces_t_XX.png
